# Movie Browsing and Favorites App

This web application allows users to browse a curated list of popular movies, search for specific movies, and select their favorite movies. The application saves the user's selected movies in **local storage**, ensuring that favorites persist across sessions.

- **Add to Favorites:** Users can select their favorite movies by clicking the "Add to Favorite" button, which stores the movies in a separate list.
